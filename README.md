# Trail Backend Ascan

This is an open project to conclude a trail for a Intern formation at
[Instituto Alt√¢ntico](https://www.atlantico.com.br/).


## About the project

This is a project that simulates a subscription service, with registration, purchase, cancel and recover of a
subscription. I've used the microservices architecture to build it and did the communication among the services with
a message broker. There is also a microservice to consume these subscriptions changes and persist the data and then
produce a message to message broker that will be consumed by a notification microservice that send the changes to
user email.

## Project achitecture

## Technologies

- RabbitMQ
- SpringBoot
- Postgres
- Keycloak
- Docker

## Building

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

### How to build

After building the project using Maven, you'll need to build the container using Docker or Docker Compose.

### Building with Docker Compose

To build the project withh all its linked services (Postgres and Microservice):

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

## Docker

### Get Started

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/userguide)
* [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder)

### Useful Docker commands

```
docker images
docker ps
docker exec -it ${containerName} bash
```
